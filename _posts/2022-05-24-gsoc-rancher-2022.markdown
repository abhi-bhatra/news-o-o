Google Summer of Code is a program organized by Google to bring budding developers into open-source environment. As the name suggests, it takes place every summer, during the months of April to August. Open-Source organizations with the code on collaborative code platforms like GitHub applies to take part as Mentor organizations in Google Summer of Code or GSoC. 

I came to know about Google Summer of Code in my junior year as an undergraduate. I attended various awareness sessions, listening to all that I felt very overwhelmed and it all felt so out of reach and I gave up even without trying. I started working on my skills and acquire a diverse tech stack before getting courage to apply at Google Summer of Code. Eventually in 2022, I vowed to myself that this year I will somehow apply for GSoC. I already had an idea about which organization I wanted to apply for, and it was openSUSE. I have been following up openSUSE and openSUSE is a constant mentor organizations to GSOC from past many years.
